### Hi there!

Iâ€™m Sofie, a postgraduate student in London, currently doing my Masterâ€™s in Systems and Synthetic Biology at [**@Imperial College**](https://github.com/imperialcollegelondon).

Iâ€™m fascinated by the intersection of biology and computer science and enjoy working on projects that help us better understand and engineer living systems.

Previously, I worked on curating a genome-scale metabolic model of *Vibrio natriegens* and analysed its amino acid metabolism in comparison with the model organism *Escherichia coli*. 
As part of [**@iGEM**](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/duesseldorf), I developed [*@ChromoBlend*](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/software-tools/duesseldorf), a software tool that uses machine learning to predict the right mix of chromoproteins for any HEX colour, making it easier to design coloured proteins for synthetic biology applications.

Looking ahead, I want to further study how combining machine learning with synthetic biology can be used to improve the predictions of biological systems.

### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Gazi**](https://gazijarin.com), a software engineer and artist in New York City.

I currently work as a software engineer at [**@Google**](https://github.com/google), where I help build Proxybidder ML models that make Google Search money. Previously, I was at [**@Amazon**](https://github.com/aws) and [**@Pinterest**](https://github.com/pinterest).

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I make [art](https://polyliths.tumblr.com/), play video games and make tech-related content (over 1M+ combined followers and counting).
