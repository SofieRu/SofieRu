### Hi there! <img src="https://media.tenor.com/MdI9bTt7NMgAAAAj/good-evening-hand-wave.gif" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m Sofie, a postgraduate student in London, currently doing my Masterâ€™s in Systems and Synthetic Biology at [**Imperial College London**](https://github.com/imperialcollegelondon).

Iâ€™m fascinated by the intersection of biology and computer science and enjoy working on projects that help us better understand and engineer living systems.

Previously, I worked on curating a genome-scale metabolic model of [***Vibrio natriegens***](https://github.com/stelmo/VibrioNatriegens) and analysed its amino acid metabolism in comparison with the model organism *Escherichia coli*. 

As part of [**iGEM**](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/duesseldorf), I developed [***ChromoBlend***](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/software-tools/duesseldorf), a software tool that uses machine learning to predict the right mix of chromoproteins for any HEX colour, making it easier to design coloured proteins for synthetic biology applications.

Looking ahead, I want to further study how combining machine learning with synthetic biology can be used to improve the predictions of biological systems.
